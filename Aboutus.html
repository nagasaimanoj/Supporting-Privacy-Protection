<p align="justify" class="style6">Personalized web search (PWS) has demonstrated its effectiveness in improving the quality of various search services on 
  the Internet. However, evidences show that users&rsquo; reluctance to disclose their private information during search has become a major 
  barrier for the wide proliferation of PWS. We study privacy protection in PWS applications that model user preferences as hierarchical 
  user profiles. We propose a PWS framework called UPS that can adaptively generalize profiles by queries while respecting userspecified 
  privacy requirements. Our runtime generalization aims at striking a balance between two predictive metrics that evaluate the 
  utility of personalization and the privacy risk of exposing the generalized profile. We present two greedy algorithms, namely GreedyDP 
  and GreedyIL, for runtime generalization. We also provide an online prediction mechanism for deciding whether personalizing a query 
  is beneficial. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. The experimental results also reveal that 
GreedyIL significantly outperforms GreedyDP in terms of efficiency.</p>

<p class="style1">  Introduction</p>
<p align="justify" class="style6"><br>
  THE web search engine has long become the most 
  important portal for ordinary people looking for useful 
  information on the web. However, users might experience 
  failure when search engines return irrelevant results that do 
  not meet their real intentions. Such irrelevance is largely 
  due to the enormous variety of users&rsquo; contexts and 
  backgrounds, as well as the ambiguity of texts. Personalized 
  web search (PWS) is a general category of search techniques 
  aiming at providing better search results, which are tailored 
  for individual user needs. As the expense, user information 
  has to be collected and analyzed to figure out the user 
  intention behind the issued query. 
  The solutions to PWS can generally be categorized into 
  two types, namely click-log-based methods and profile-based 
  ones. The click-log based methods are straightforward&mdash; 
  they simply impose bias to clicked pages in the user&rsquo;s query 
  history. Although this strategy has been demonstrated to 
  perform consistently and considerably well [1], it can only 
  work on repeated queries from the same user, which is a 
  strong limitation confining its applicability. In contrast,<br>
  profile-based methods improve the search experience with 
  complicated user-interest models generated from user 
  profiling techniques. Profile-based methods can be potentially 
  effective for almost all sorts of queries, but are 
reported to be unstable under some circumstances [1].</p>
